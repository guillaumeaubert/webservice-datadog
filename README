WebService-DataDog

This module allows you to interact with DataDog, a service that will "Capture
metrics and events, then graph, filter, and search to see what's happening and 
how systems interact." This module encapsulates all the communications with the
REST API provided by DataDog to offer a Perl interface to metrics, dashboards,
events, alerts, etc.

Requests that write data require reporting access and require an API key.
Requests that read data require full access and also require an application key.

You can find your API key, and generate application keys at
https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings

**NOTE: This is in the development stage and has reduced functionality currently,
supporting the posting of metrics, creating/viewing/updating dashboards, and
searching/viewing/posting events to DDog event stream.

I intend to continue updating, eventually adding all functionality that
DataDog-provided Ruby and Python API libraries have.


Features coming soon (not necessarily in this order):
* existing module 'Dashboard'
  - extensive error checking when updating a dashboard
  - adding 'delete' function
* new module 'Tag'
  - getting all tags; getting tags on specified host
  - adding/updating tags for a specific host
  - removing host tags
* new module 'Alert'
  - create alerts
  - retrieve details on one/all alerts
  - delete an alert
  - mute/unmute all alerts
* new module 'Comment'
  - created/edit/delete 
* new module 'Search'
