WebService-DataDog

This module allows you to interact with DataDog, a service that will "Capture
metrics and events, then graph, filter, and search to see what's happening and 
how systems interact." This module encapsulates all the communications with the
REST API provided by DataDog to offer a Perl interface to metrics, dashboards,
events, alerts, etc.

Requests that write data require reporting access and require an API key.
Requests that read data require full access and also require an application key.

You can find your API key, and generate application keys at
https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings

**NOTE: This is in the development stage and has little functionality currently,
except for posting metrics.  I intend to continue updating, eventually adding all
functionality that DataDog-provided Ruby and Python API libraries have.
